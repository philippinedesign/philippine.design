    <p>
      <span class="highlight">PHILIPPINE.DESIGN</span> is a research initiative investigating the identity, history, and position of the Filipino designer. We pursue archival, publishing, and research as key methods of inquiry in naming 'Filipino design'. Committed to decentering Western narratives and recentering intersectional, indigenous practices not only across graphic & product design, but design's everyday manifestationsâ€”particularly in design as social practice.
    </p>

    <p>We're maintained by <a href="https://developh.org">Developh</a>, a community of practice reclaiming technology as a tool for liberation rather than oppression; stewarded by <a href="https://chia.design">Chia Amisola</a>, a Tondo-born SF-based designer.</p>
